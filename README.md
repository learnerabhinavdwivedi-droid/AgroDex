## About The Project

The Problem
<br>
Food fraud and missing traceability drain billions from Indonesian agricultural sector. Farmers cannot prove premium quality (e.g., organic), and buyers cannot verify authenticity, hurting trust and revenue.

Our Hedera-Based Solution offer AgroDex to creates a digital twin (NFT) for every batch, audited by AI and anchored to Hedera for an immutable trail of evidence.

## Hedera Integration Summary (Required)
We chose Hedera because predictable, low fees are the only sustainable option for low-margin Indonesian logistics.

Hedera Services Utilized
Hedera Consensus Service (HCS): Every “proof” event (planting, harvest, etc.) is submitted via TopicMessageSubmitTransaction to our topic ID, producing a low-cost (~$0.0001) immutable audit log.
Hedera Token Service (HTS): We mint the final certificate as a unique NFT using TokenCreateTransaction.HCS transaction IDs are embedded in the NFT metadata, binding the asset to its evidence trail.
Mirror Nodes: The Verify page queries Mirror Nodes (via the SDK) to replay the HCS history and demonstrate authenticity to judges and buyers.
Economic Justification
Adoption in Indonesia demands sub-$1 fees per transaction. Hedera’s fixed, negligible HCS pricing lets us log thousands of events for a few dollars, keeping the business model viable.

## Key Features
## Traceability (Hedera)
- HCS Logging: Capture every lifecycle event on Hedera Consensus Service.
- HTS Tokenization: Mint NFT certificates that reference the HCS history.
- Verification: Buyers validate authenticity by reading the full Mirror Node history.
## Intelligence (Gemini AI)
- Audit & Trust Score: AI reviews the HCS timeline to produce a 0–100 trust score.
- Bilingual Summaries: Generates provenance summaries in English.
- Buyer Q&A Chatbot: Buyers “talk” to the batch history; AI answers with cited HCS transaction IDs.
- Dashboard Insight: AI provides real-time business insights that surface on the main dashboard.

## Getting Started

This is the instruction about how to get work with this project:
### Installation

1. Clone the Repository
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/daviddprtma/AgroDex
   cd AgroDex
   ```
2. Install Dependencies
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Configure Environment Variables
   
   - **Frontend**: Copy `.env.example` at the root of the project to `.env`:
     ```sh
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     Open `.env` and configure `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`. Contributors need to obtain their own WalletConnect Project ID by registering their dApp on the [WalletConnect Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).
     
   - **Backend**: Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`:
     ```sh
     cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
     ```
     Edit `backend/.env` and fill in: `OPERATOR_ID`, `OPERATOR_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`.
4. Seed the demo data
   ```sh
   cd backend
   node scripts/seedDemo.js
   ```
5. Run the application
 ```sh
   # Terminal 1 (Backend)
cd backend
pnpm run dev

# Terminal 2 (Frontend)
cd ..
pnpm run dev
   ```
