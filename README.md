## 📖 About The Project

### 🛑 The Problem
Food fraud and missing traceability drain billions from the Indonesian agricultural sector. Farmers cannot prove premium quality (e.g., organic), and buyers cannot verify authenticity, severely hurting industry trust and revenue.

### 🛡️ Our Hedera-Based Solution
**AgroDex** creates a digital twin (NFT) for every crop batch. Every milestone is audited by AI and securely anchored to Hedera to create an immutable, lifelong trail of evidence.

## ⛓️ Hedera Integration Summary

We chose Hedera because predictable, low fees are the only sustainable option for low-margin Indonesian logistics.

### 🏛️ Hedera Services Utilized
* **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS):** Every “proof” event (planting, harvest, etc.) is submitted via `TopicMessageSubmitTransaction` to our topic ID, producing a low-cost (~$0.0001) immutable audit log.
* **Hedera Token Service (HTS):** We mint the final certificate as a unique NFT using `TokenCreateTransaction`. HCS transaction IDs are embedded directly into the NFT metadata, structurally binding the asset to its evidence trail.
* **Mirror Nodes:** The Verify page queries Mirror Nodes (via the SDK) to replay the HCS history and seamlessly demonstrate authenticity to buyers and judges.

### 💰 Economic Justification
Widespread adoption in Indonesia demands sub-$1 fees per transaction. Hedera’s fixed, negligible HCS pricing lets us log thousands of logistical events for just a few dollars, keeping the business model completely viable.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Traceability (Powered by Hedera)
* **HCS Logging:** Capture every step of the crop lifecycle transparently.
* **HTS Tokenization:** Mint NFT certificates referencing immutable HCS history.
* **Verification Engine:** Buyers validate authenticity instantly by fetching real-time Mirror Node history.

### 🤖 Intelligence (Powered by Gemini AI)
* **Audit & Trust Score:** AI parses the HCS timeline to yield an objective 0–100 trust rating.
* **Bilingual Summaries:** Automatically generates intuitive provenance summaries in English and Indonesian.
* **Buyer Q&A Chatbot:** Buyers can interact directly with a batch's history; the AI replies with cited HCS transaction IDs.
* **Dashboard Insights:** Real-time business intelligence metrics surfacing on the main admin layout.
